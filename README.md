# I AM Barrymc1
I am quite a novice at coding but i know more than a beginner, i want to keep developing my skills so i can become a devleoper.Here is a link to my github portfolio [Github profile](https://github.com/barrymc1), there isnt much in terms of code there at the moment but plenty more will be coming soon. In my spare time i like to cycle a lot, play some music and watch the footy when i get a chance.

Growth Mindset

growth mindset helps people to develop, overcome challenges, be confident in their ability. Having a growth mindset is extremely vauable in life and gives a person many more options personally and professionally because they are more likely to have new experiences that willl help to change their perceptions on life, work, family and more.

### 3 ways to stay in a growth mindset

1. Think of what **can** happen , not what wont happen
2. Visualise your sucess/goals 
3. Always be willing to learn, never think that you know everything on a subject
