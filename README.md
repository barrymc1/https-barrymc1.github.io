Having a growth mindset is extremely vauable in life and gives a person many more options personally and professionally because they are more likely to have new experiences that willl help to change their perceptions on life, work, family and more.

### 3 ways to stay in a growth mindset

1. Think of what **can** happen , not what wont happen
2. Visualise your sucess/goals 
3. Always be willing to learn, never think that you know everything on a subject
